Simple example to a mobile web app that let users read nad listen to tech podcasts like: javaposse, 37 signals, twit and others.
Comments are most welcome...

TODO:
1. Use a better lib to the audio tag - let the user save the episode and listen to it in offline mode.
2. Let the user define/grep podcasts from iTune (or other sources).
3. Improve the UX and wrap this view using phoneGap.
